%description XML based Constructive Solid Geometry. 
%description xcsg is an XML file protocol and an application 
%description for creating 3d solid models based on Constructive 
%description Solid Geometry (CSG). The file protocol provides a 
%description way to define primitives, transformations and 
%description operators for 2d and 3d objects. The xcsg application
%description processes this information, creating a 3d solid model.
%description xcsg may be used under the terms of either the GNU
